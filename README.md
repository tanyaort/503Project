# 503Project

## Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction

This project is a part of the ADS-503 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

## Project Status 

Active

## Installation

This project was completed in RStudio using .Rmd and .R files. To reproduce or run this project:

Clone this repository from GitHub: 

Open the R project or .Rmd file in RStudio

Install the required packages (e.g., tidyverse, caret, corrplot, pROC)

Run the script section by section to explore the data, preprocess, split, and train models

## Project Intro/Objective

This project has a primary objective of developing a predictive model that predicts the risk of cervical cancer based on behavioral, demographic and clinical risk factors. This work aims to help with early identification and preventive care through the prediction of those who may be able to undergo screening in a timely manner.

We are utilizing the Cervical Cancer Risk Factors dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which consists of features that include: age, number of sexual partners, contraceptive use, STD history and smoking.
